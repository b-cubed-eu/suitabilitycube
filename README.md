# Suitability Cube 
The **Suitability Cube (SC)** is a reproducible, multidimensional structure designed to critically evaluate the outcomes of species distribution models (SDMs) in relation to the environmental data on which they are built. By organizing information across space, time, and taxa, the SC links species occurrence records with environmental predictors within a unified analytical framework, allowing a more transparent assessment of habitat suitability patterns and model reliability.

SC incorporates measures of environmental distance, which quantify how different the environmental conditions at prediction sites are from those represented in the training data. This allows identifying where model projections are environmentally supported and where they involve extrapolation into unfamiliar conditions. It also integrates metrics of niche breadth (derived from hypervolumes) to describe the ecological space occupied by each species and the Area of Applicability (AOA) to delineate the environmental domain within which model predictions can be considered valid.

By integrating these components, the SC provides a coherent system for comparing species and time periods, highlighting environmentally uncertain regions, and identifying where models can be meaningfully interpreted. Ultimately, the Suitability Cube enhances the critical evaluation of SDMs by linking what the model predicts to where those predictions should be trusted, fostering more transparent, reproducible, and ecologically grounded modelling practices. 

## Key concepts 
* **Hypervolume (HV)**: it represents a species’ ecological niche as an n-dimensional region defined by environmental variables, following the concept introduced by Hutchinson (1957). Each axis corresponds to an independent and ecologically relevant factor, such as temperature or precipitation, and the resulting hypervolume encompasses all combinations of conditions under which the species can persist.
* **Environmental Distance (Dissimilarity Index, DI)**: It quantifies how different the environmental conditions at a prediction site are from those represented in the training (occurrence) data. Following the method of Meyer & Pebesma (2021), DI is computed as a standardized distance in a multidimensional predictor space that has been (i) standardized, (ii) weighted by variable importance, and (iii) expressed relative to typical distances between training samples. This provides a unitless, comparable measure of environmental novelty
* **Area of Applicability (AOA)**: the Area of Applicability (AOA) defines the spatial domain where model predictions can be considered environmentally supported by the training data. It is computed directly from the Dissimilarity Index (DI) and provides a binary, spatially explicit assessment of whether a prediction site lies inside or outside the environmental space represented during model training (Meyer & Pebesma 2021).
