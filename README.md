# Suitability Cube

The **Suitability Cube (SC)** is a reproducible, multidimensional
structure designed to critically evaluate the outcomes of species
distribution models (SDMs) in relation to the environmental data on
which they are built. By organizing information across space, time, and
taxa, the SC links species occurrence records with environmental
predictors within a unified analytical framework, allowing a more
transparent assessment of habitat suitability patterns and model
reliability.

SC incorporates measures of environmental distance, which quantify how
different the environmental conditions at prediction sites are from
those represented in the training data. This allows identifying where
model projections are environmentally supported and where they involve
extrapolation into unfamiliar conditions. It also integrates metrics of
niche breadth (derived from hypervolumes) to describe the ecological
space occupied by each species and the Area of Applicability (AOA) to
delineate the environmental domain within which model predictions can be
considered valid.

By integrating these components, the SC provides a coherent system for
comparing species and time periods, highlighting environmentally
uncertain regions, and identifying where models can be meaningfully
interpreted. Ultimately, the Suitability Cube enhances the critical
evaluation of SDMs by linking what the model predicts to where those
predictions should be trusted, fostering more transparent, reproducible,
and ecologically grounded modelling practices.

## Key concepts

- **Hypervolume (HV)**: it represents a species’ ecological niche as an
  n-dimensional region defined by environmental variables, following the
  concept introduced by Hutchinson (1957). Each axis corresponds to an
  independent and ecologically relevant factor, such as temperature or
  precipitation, and the resulting hypervolume encompasses all
  combinations of conditions under which the species can persist.

- **Environmental Distance (Dissimilarity Index, DI)**: It quantifies
  how different the environmental conditions at a prediction site are
  from those represented in the training (occurrence) data. Following
  the method of Meyer & Pebesma (2021), DI is computed as a standardized
  distance in a multidimensional predictor space that has been (i)
  standardized, (ii) weighted by variable importance, and (iii)
  expressed relative to typical distances between training samples. This
  provides a unitless, comparable measure of environmental novelty

- **Area of Applicability (AOA)**: the Area of Applicability (AOA)
  defines the spatial domain where model predictions can be considered
  environmentally supported by the training data. It is computed
  directly from the Dissimilarity Index (DI) and provides a binary,
  spatially explicit assessment of whether a prediction site lies inside
  or outside the environmental space represented during model training
  (Meyer & Pebesma 2021).

## Conceptual workflow

The conceptual workflow underlying the Suitability Cube (SC) consists of
4 main phases: **data acquisition**, **pre-processing**, **indicator
computation**, and **cube building**. The workflow is organized into
sequential, reproducible steps that ensure a coherent progression from
data acquisition to cube construction while remaining flexible enough to
accommodate different user needs and modelling contexts.

1.  **Data download**. In the first stage, the necessary input data are
    collected and harmonized: the **national boundary**, **bioclimatic
    predictors** and **species occurrence data**. To reduce collinearity
    among predictors, a correlation-based variable selection is
    performed on the present dataset, and the same subset of variables
    is applied to future scenarios to maintain temporal consistency.

2.  **Pre-processing**. Following data acquisition, environmental and
    occurrence datasets are cleaned and harmonized.

3.  **Indicators**. This phase focuses on deriving three diagnostic
    indicators (HV, DI, AOA) that form the informational core of the
    Suitability Cube. All of them are computed from the same
    environmental predictors and occurrence data used to train the SDMs,
    ensuring consistency between model inputs and their evaluation.

4.  **Cube building**. This phase integrates all indicators into a
    unified, three-dimensional structure that organizes information
    across space, species, and time.

### Setup

This configuration defines the spatial, temporal, and taxonomic
parameters used throughout the workflow.

``` r
## 1. User inputs (EDIT here)
params <- list(
  species      = c("Bufo bufo", "Bufotes viridis", "Bombina variegata"),
  country_name = "Italy",
  country_iso  = "IT",
  res_arcmin   = 2.5,
  ssp_code     = "245",
  gcm_model    = "BCC-CSM2-MR",
  period       = "2041-2060",
  outdir       = tempdir(),      # change to a persistent path if desired
  gbif_years   = c(2010, 2020),
  gbif_limit   = 20000,
  cor_thr      = 0.7,
  cor_frac     = 0.10,
  grid_cellsize_deg = 0.25,      # ~25 km
  grid_square      = FALSE       # FALSE = hex, TRUE = square
)
```

### Data download

Bioclimatic variables for the present period were downloaded from
WorldClim, while those for the future were retrieved from CMIP6 for the
selected Global Circulation Model (BCC-CSM2-MR), scenario (SSP245), and
time window (2041–2060). Both datasets were downloaded at a spatial
resolution of 2.5′ (~5 km).

After download, each dataset was cropped and masked to the national
boundary of Italy, retrieved with `geodata::gadm()`. To guarantee
spatial comparability, the present raster stack was aligned to the
future using the custom helper function `align_to()`, which resamples
the data to a common extent, resolution, and coordinate reference
system.

Following alignment, a correlation-based variable selection was applied
to the present bioclimatic dataset to reduce multicollinearity among
predictors. Pairwise correlations were computed on a 10% random sample
of grid cells, and variables exceeding a threshold of 0.7 were
iteratively removed using the custom function `drop_high_corr()`.

The resulting subset of predictors, `bio3`, `bio4`, `bio8`, `bio11`,
`bio14`, and `bio16`, was retained as the final set of environmental
variables. The same subset was then applied to the future dataset to
ensure temporal consistency.

Species occurrence records were retrieved from GBIF using the R package
`rgbif`: \* Three amphibians: Bufo bufo, Bufotes viridis, Bombina
variegata) \* Country = IT, \* Years = 2010–2020, \* Record cap = 20,000
per species.

``` r
# country boundary
country_vec <- geodata::gadm(params$country_name, level = 0, path = params$outdir)

# present bioclimatic predictors
bio_present <- geodata::worldclim_country(
  country = params$country_name, var = "bio", res = params$res_arcmin, path = params$outdir
) |> terra::crop(country_vec) |> terra::mask(country_vec)

# future bioclimatic predictors
bio_future <- geodata::cmip6_world(
  model = params$gcm_model, ssp = params$ssp_code, time = params$period,
  var = "bio", res = params$res_arcmin, path = params$outdir
) |> terra::crop(country_vec) |> terra::mask(country_vec)

# align_to aligns a raster stack to a target grid (bilinear)
bio_present_aligned <- align_to(bio_present, bio_future)

## 2. Variable selection (on PRESENT)
cor_res   <- drop_high_corr(bio_present_aligned, thr = params$cor_thr, frac = params$cor_frac)
cmat      <- cor_res$cor
vars_keep <- cor_res$selected
vars_drop <- cor_res$dropped

# align names (do this once right after creating bio_future)
names(bio_future) <- names(bio_present_aligned)

# keep same variables in the future
bio_present_sel <- bio_present_aligned[[vars_keep]]
bio_future_sel  <- bio_future[[vars_keep]]

## 3. GBIF occurrences --------------------------------------------------------

### Hypervolume

In this workflow, the hypervolume is empirically estimated from observed
species occurrences and their associated environmental predictors. The
computation is performed using the R package `hypervolume` (Blonder et
al., 2018), which applies a Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE)
method (`hypervolume_gaussian`) to model the probability density of
species occurrences in environmental space. The hypervolume is computed
only for the present period, as it depends on empirical occurrences that
are not available for future conditions and could be affected by
dispersal limitations or niche shifts.

- `extract_predictors_at_points`: extracts raster values at point
  locations, keeps only selected predictor variables, removes rows with
  missing values, and drops numeric predictors with zero variance.

- `z_transform`: numeric columns are standardized (mean 0, sd 1).
  Missing values are replaced with the column mean prior to
  standardization. Columns with zero variance become all zeros

- `compute_global_bw`: uses `hypervolume::estimate_bandwidth` on the
  predictor matrix. Returns 1 if estimation fails or produces non-finite
  values

- `hyp_calc`: computes a Gaussian hypervolume using
  `hypervolume::hypervolume_gaussian` and returns the volume. Returns NA
  if there are insufficient unique points or if the computation fails

- Wrapper loop: iterates over all species to compute individual
  hypervolume values for the present period

``` r
pred_vars_present <- names(bio_present_sel)
hv_by_species     <- setNames(vector("list", length(params$species)), params$species)

# hypervolume calculation
for (sp in params$species) {
  occ_sf <- occ_list[[sp]]
  if (is.null(occ_sf) || nrow(occ_sf) == 0) { hv_by_species[[sp]] <- NA_real_; next }
  train_df  <- extract_predictors_at_points(bio_present_sel, occ_sf, pred_vars_present)
  if (nrow(train_df) < (ncol(train_df)+1L)) { hv_by_species[[sp]] <- NA_real_; next }
  z_df <- z_transform(train_df)
  hv_by_species[[sp]] <- hyp_calc(z_df, compute_global_bw(z_df))
}
```

### AOA and DI

A set of functions was implemented to automate the computation of DI and
the AOA for each species. Some functions overlap with those used for
hypervolume estimation, ensuring consistency across indicators.

- `extract_predictors_at_points`: extracts environmental variable values
  from raster layers at species occurrence locations (also used in
  Hypervolume computation)

- `z_transform`: standardizes environmental predictors to make them
  comparable across variables (shared with Hypervolume workflow)

- `compute_aoa_pair`: computes the DI for both present and future
  environmental rasters using `CAST::aoa()`, which simultaneously
  derives the DI and the corresponding AOA

- Wrapper loop: iterates over all species to compute per-species DI and
  AOA values for the present and future periods, skipping species with
  insufficient training data.

``` r
aoa_di_by_species <- setNames(vector("list", length(params$species)), params$species)

for (sp in params$species) {
  occ_sf <- occ_list[[sp]]
  if (is.null(occ_sf) || nrow(occ_sf) == 0) { aoa_di_by_species[[sp]] <- NULL; next }
  train_df <- extract_predictors_at_points(bio_present_sel, occ_sf, pred_vars_present)
  if (nrow(train_df) < 5 || ncol(train_df) < 1) { aoa_di_by_species[[sp]] <- NULL; next }
  aoa_di_by_species[[sp]] <- compute_aoa_pair(train_df, new_present = bio_present_sel, new_future = bio_future_sel)
}
```

    ## No trainDI provided.

    ## note: variables were not weighted either because no weights or model were given,
    ##     no variable importance could be retrieved from the given model, or the model has a single feature.
    ##     Check caret::varImp(model)

    ## note: No model and no CV folds were given. The DI threshold is therefore based on all training data

    ## No trainDI provided.

    ## note: variables were not weighted either because no weights or model were given,
    ##     no variable importance could be retrieved from the given model, or the model has a single feature.

    ## note: variables were not weighted either because no weights or model were given,
    ##     no variable importance could be retrieved from the given model, or the model has a single feature.

    ## No trainDI provided.

    ## note: variables were not weighted either because no weights or model were given,
    ##     no variable importance could be retrieved from the given model, or the model has a single feature.
    ##     Check caret::varImp(model)

    ## note: No model and no CV folds were given. The DI threshold is therefore based on all training data

    ## note: variables were not weighted either because no weights or model were given,
    ##     no variable importance could be retrieved from the given model, or the model has a single feature.

### Cube building

This phase organizes all previously computed indicators, HV, DI and AOA,
into a unified, multidimensional structure that enables consistent
spatial, temporal, and taxonomic analysis. The resulting cube is
implemented in R using the `stars` package, which supports
multidimensional data aligned by space, time, and species. Custom
functions developed for this workflow are:

- `as_stars_on_grid`: aggregates raster values to polygon grid cells and
  converts outputs to stars format

- `build_metric_cube`: builds multi-dimensional stars cubes (AOA or DI)
  by aggregating indicators across species and time

- `build_hv_cube`: generates the hypervolume cube by inserting scalar
  niche-size values per species

- `merge_cubes`: combines all indicator cubes into a single
  multi-attribute data cube aligned by dimensions

The process is made by the following steps, that aim to reduce the
dimensionality and compress all the information in a single,
reproducible object:

``` r
# inputs & grid params
species_vec  <- params$species
cellsize_deg <- params$grid_cellsize_deg
make_square  <- isTRUE(params$grid_square)

# country boundary (sf)
country_vec <- if (exists("prelim")) prelim$country_vec else geodata::gadm(params$country_name, 0, params$outdir)
country_sf  <- sf::st_as_sf(country_vec) |> sf::st_buffer(0)

# build the cell grid
grid_cells <- sf::st_make_grid(country_sf, cellsize = cellsize_deg,
                               what = "polygons", square = make_square) |>
  sf::st_as_sf() |>
  dplyr::mutate(cell = seq_len(dplyr::n()))
sf::st_crs(grid_cells) <- 4326

# keep only species that actually have AOA/DI
species_vec <- species_vec[species_vec %in% names(aoa_di_by_species) & !vapply(aoa_di_by_species, is.null, TRUE)]
stopifnot(length(species_vec) > 0)

AOA_cube <- build_metric_cube(
  aoa_di_by_species = aoa_di_by_species,
  species_vec = species_vec,
  grid_cells = grid_cells,
  metric = "AOA"
)

DI_cube <- build_metric_cube(
  aoa_di_by_species = aoa_di_by_species,
  species_vec = species_vec,
  grid_cells = grid_cells,
  metric = "DI"
)

### Output

The workflow produces a multi-attribute environmental data cube,
implemented as a `stars` object in R. The cube integrates the three
indicators, Area of Applicability, Environmental Distance, and
Hypervolume, into a single, coherent structure that supports spatial,
temporal, and taxonomic analysis of model-related indicators. The cube
has three dimensions: `cell`, `taxon`, and `time`, corresponding
respectively to spatial grid units, species, and temporal steps (present
and future). Each cell contains the computed attributes.

- **AOA** (binary): identifies areas within or outside the model’s
  environmental

- **DI** (continuous): quantifies how distant local environmental
  conditions are from those represented in the training data

- **HV** (scalar per species): describes the niche breadth, available
  only for the present period

### Basic usage

This multidimensional structure allows the exploration, visualization,
and comparison of ecological indicators across locations, species, and
time, while maintaining full alignment between environmental and spatial
data. Some ways the data cube can be used.

#### Locate a cell for a given coordinate

Identifies which grid cell a given geographic coordinate belongs to and
displays it on a map for visual inspection.

``` r
# Define a point (lon, lat) in EPSG:4326
pt <- st_sf(geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(12.5, 42.5)), crs = 4326))

# Which grid cell contains the point?
which_cell <- suppressWarnings(st_join(pt, grid_cells, join = st_intersects))
if (is.na(which_cell$cell)) {
   message("❌ This point is NOT within the study area.")
 } else {
   cell_id <- which_cell$cell
   message(sprintf("Point falls inside cell #%d", cell_id))
 }
```

    ## Point falls inside cell #1361

#### Basic introspection and slice

Examine the cube’s organization, dimensions, and extent, enabling the
inspection of selected indicators or specific subsets.

``` r
# Spatial extent of the cube (bbox of all cells)
print(st_bbox(data_cube))
```

    ##      xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax 
    ##  6.362442 35.280385 18.737442 47.476909

``` r
# Slice example (confirm dims order): [cell, taxon, time]
# AOA & DI arrays’ shape
dim(data_cube[c("AOA","DI")])
```

    ##  cell taxon  time 
    ##  2744     3     2

``` r
# Cell 1361, both species, PRESENT (time = 1)
data_cube[,1361, , 1]

#### Build a pairwise DI-difference cube (cell x comparison x time)

Creates a new cube that expresses the difference in environmental
dissimilarity between species, per cell and time step, highlighting
which species occupy more novel environmental conditions.

``` r
# Example: all pairwise differences (default)
DI_diff_cube <- build_DI_diff_cube(data_cube)
DI_diff_cube

#### Plot DI differences for a single cell

Visualizes pairwise DI contrasts within one location, showing which
species experience greater environmental distance in the present and
future.

``` r
cell_id <- 1361
slice_diff <- DI_diff_cube[, cell_id, , drop = FALSE]
df_diff <- as.data.frame(slice_diff) |> dplyr::select(comparison, time, DI_diff)

df_diff
```

    ##                            comparison    time     DI_diff
    ## 1         Bufo bufo - Bufotes viridis present -0.36231409
    ## 2       Bufo bufo - Bombina variegata present -0.33427731
    ## 3 Bufotes viridis - Bombina variegata present  0.02803679
    ## 4         Bufo bufo - Bufotes viridis  future -0.14688984
    ## 5       Bufo bufo - Bombina variegata  future -0.28759642
    ## 6 Bufotes viridis - Bombina variegata  future -0.14070657

#### Summarize AOA coverage

Calculates the proportion of the study area that falls inside or outside
the Area of Applicability for each species and time period.

``` r
aoa_df <- as.data.frame(data_cube["AOA"]) |>
  dplyr::select(taxon, time, AOA) |>
  mutate(AOA = as.integer(round(AOA)))  # ensure 0/1

aoa_counts <- aoa_df |>
  group_by(taxon, time, AOA) |>
  summarise(n_cells = n(), .groups = "drop")

print(head(aoa_counts))
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 4
    ##   taxon     time      AOA n_cells
    ##   <fct>     <fct>   <int>   <int>
    ## 1 Bufo bufo present     0     263
    ## 2 Bufo bufo present     1     512
    ## 3 Bufo bufo present    NA    1969
    ## 4 Bufo bufo future      0     811
    ## 5 Bufo bufo future      1       5
    ## 6 Bufo bufo future     NA    1928

### Application to SDMs

After constructing and exploring the multi-attribute environmental cube,
the next step is to connect these indicators to an actual species
distribution model (SDM). We employ the R package `dismo` (Hijmans et
al., 2023), one of the most established frameworks for building and
evaluating SDMs.

We use `dismo` to fit a simple SDM as a proof of concept, generating a
continuous suitability surface that can then be incorporated into the
existing cube. The goal is not model optimization but to show how such
predictions can be spatially aligned and aggregated in the same grid
structure used for the AOA and DI metrics. A key advantage of this
integrated approach is the ability to mask or “clip” model predictions
according to the Area of Applicability (AOA). Since the AOA identifies
regions of environmental space similar to those seen during model
training, restricting predictions to within this area effectively
filters out extrapolations beyond the model’s domain of validity.

This step transforms the SDM from a purely predictive surface into a
context-aware product, in which suitability values are interpreted only
where the underlying environmental relationships are supported by the
data. This section illustrates: \* How an SDM output can be aligned with
the cube’s spatial structure \* How it can be aggregated with the main
cube \* How the AOA mask can be applied to highlight the parts of the
prediction that are environmentally valid, turning the cube into a
coherent framework that combines modeling, uncertainty, and
applicability within a single data object

**No new functions are introduced in this section**. The process reuses
the previously defined helper `as_stars_on_grid`.

#### SDM fitting and alignment with SC’s structure

For each species (here: Bufo bufo, Bufotes viridis, Bombina variegata):

- Extract GBIF occurrences from the previously downloaded dataset
  (`occ_list`), and ensure they are in geographic coordinates
  (EPSG:4326)

- Extract coordinates (`lon`, `lat`) from the spatial object to create a
  numeric matrix compatible with `dismo` functions

- Fit the BIOCLIM model using the `bioclim()` function, which takes a
  stack of environmental predictors and the occurrence coordinates as
  input

- Generate suitability predictions for both the present and future
  climate scenarios using `raster::predict()`. The output is a
  continuous raster surface where each cell’s value ranges from 0
  (unsuitable) to 1 (highly suitable).

This process is repeated for all target species, producing two raster
outputs per species (present and future suitability).

``` r
library(dismo)

# climatic predictors for SDM
env_present_rs <- raster::stack(bio_present_sel)
env_future_rs  <- raster::stack(bio_future_sel)

# 1.1 Extract occurrence points (sf) for the species
occ_bufo <- occ_list[["Bufo bufo"]]
occ_bufotes <- occ_list[["Bufotes viridis"]]
occ_bombina <- occ_list[["Bombina variegata"]]

# 1.2 Force to WGS84 lon/lat coordinates (EPSG:4326)
occ_bufo <- st_transform(occ_bufo, crs = "EPSG:4326")
occ_bufotes <- st_transform(occ_bufotes, crs = "EPSG:4326")
occ_bombina <- st_transform(occ_bombina, crs = "EPSG:4326")


# 1.3 Extract lon/lat matrix for dismo
pres_xy_bufo <- st_coordinates(occ_bufo)
pres_xy_bufotes <- st_coordinates(occ_bufotes)
pres_xy_bombina <- st_coordinates(occ_bombina)

# 1.4 Fit a simple BIOCLIM SDM using current climate predictors
bc_bufo <- dismo::bioclim(env_present_rs, pres_xy_bufo)
bc_bufotes <- dismo::bioclim(env_present_rs, pres_xy_bufotes)
bc_bombina <- dismo::bioclim(env_present_rs, pres_xy_bombina)

# 1.5 Predict habitat suitability under present climate
suit_present_bufo <- raster::predict(env_present_rs, bc_bufo)
suit_present_bufotes <- raster::predict(env_present_rs, bc_bufotes)
suit_present_bombina <- raster::predict(env_present_rs, bc_bombina)
plot(suit_present_bufo, col = viridis(100))
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# 1.6 Predict habitat suitability under future climate
suit_future_bufo  <- raster::predict(env_future_rs,  bc_bufo)
suit_future_bufotes  <- raster::predict(env_future_rs,  bc_bufotes)
suit_future_bombina  <- raster::predict(env_future_rs,  bc_bombina)
plot(suit_future_bufo, col = viridis(100))
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Build suitability cube

The suitability maps produced by the SDMs are then converted into a
unified stars data cube. This step ensures that predicted suitability
values are expressed on the same spatial grid and share the same species
(`taxon`) and temporal (`time`) dimensions as the environmental
indicators. The resulting cube enables consistent comparison and masking
operations across indicators.

1.  Define species order. The vector `species_vec` is defined and
    checked to ensure that all species appear in the correct order
    across analyses

2.  Organize SDM outputs. Suitability rasters from the BIOCLIM models
    are grouped into two lists: one for present conditions and one for
    future conditions

3.  Aggregate to the analysis grid. Each raster is aggregated over the
    polygon grid previously created using the helper `as_stars_on_grid`

4.  Stack species along the taxon dimension. The aggregated suitability
    layers for each time period are stacked into two separate cubes, one
    for the present and one for the future

5.  Combine time periods. The present and future cubes are merged along
    a new “time” dimension

6.  Finalize structure. Dimension names and attribute labels are
    standardized, and the final cube contains a single attribute,
    `suitability`

``` r
# 2.1 Species order (must match everything else in the project)
species_vec <- params$species
stopifnot(all(species_vec == c("Bufo bufo", "Bufotes viridis", "Bombina variegata")))

# 2.2 Put all suitability rasters into named lists (one for present, one for future)
#     NOTE: these are RasterLayer objects right now
suitability_present_list <- list("Bufo bufo" = suit_present_bufo,
  "Bufotes viridis"        = suit_present_bufotes,
  "Bombina variegata"  = suit_present_bombina
)

suitability_future_list <- list(
  "Bufo bufo"              = suit_future_bufo,
  "Bufotes viridis"        = suit_future_bufotes,
  "Bombina variegata"  = suit_future_bombina
)

# 2.3 Aggregate suitability to the analysis grid for each species and time.
suit_present_grid_list <- lapply(species_vec, function(sp) {
  as_stars_on_grid(
    sr    = terra::rast(suitability_present_list[[sp]]),
    grid  = grid_cells,
    fun   = mean,
    name  = "suitability",
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
})
names(suit_present_grid_list) <- species_vec

suit_future_grid_list <- lapply(species_vec, function(sp) {
  as_stars_on_grid(
    sr   = terra::rast(suitability_future_list[[sp]]),
    grid = grid_cells,
    fun  = mean,
    name = "suitability",
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
})

# 2.4 Stack species along a new "taxon" dimension for PRESENT
suit_present_cube <- do.call(c, suit_present_grid_list) |>
  stars::st_redimension() |>
  stars::st_set_dimensions(2, values = species_vec, names = "taxon")

# 2.5 Stack species along "taxon" for FUTURE
suit_future_cube <- do.call(c, suit_future_grid_list) |>
  stars::st_redimension() |>
  stars::st_set_dimensions(2, values = species_vec, names = "taxon")

# 2.6 Stack PRESENT and FUTURE along a new "time" dimension
suit_cube <- c(
  suit_present_cube,
  suit_future_cube,
  along = list(time = c("present", "future"))
)

# 2.7 Make sure dimension names and attribute name are clean/standard
suit_cube <- stars::st_set_dimensions(suit_cube, 1, names = "cell")
names(suit_cube) <- "suitability"

plot(suit_cube)
```

#### Merge suitability into the global data cube

After building the standalone suitability cube (suit_cube), this step
integrates it into the main `data_cube` that already contains AOA,
environmental distance (DI), and hypervolume (HV). The goal is to obtain
a single multi-attribute cube where all indicators, including modeled
suitability, are co-located in the same data structure.

- **Match dimensions**. The taxonomic (taxon) and temporal (time)
  dimensions of suit_cube are explicitly aligned to those already
  defined in data_cube.

- **Concatenate cubes**. The suitability cube is then appended to the
  existing data_cube using c(…).

- **Sanity check**. The dimensions of the updated data_cube are
  inspected, and the attribute names are printed to verify that
  “suitability” is now part of the object.

The result is a single, enriched data_cube that stores:

1.  Spatial cells

2.  Species

3.  Time steps

Multiple attributes: AOA, DI, HV, suitability.

This unified structure can then be queried, sliced, plotted, or
summarized as one coherent object.

``` r
# 3.1 Align taxon/time labels to match the existing data_cube
suit_cube <- stars::st_set_dimensions(
  suit_cube,
  "taxon",
  values = stars::st_dimensions(data_cube)$taxon$values
)

suit_cube <- stars::st_set_dimensions(
  suit_cube,
  "time",
  values = stars::st_dimensions(data_cube)$time$values
)

# 3.2 Add "suitability" as a new attribute/band in data_cube
data_cube <- c(data_cube, suit_cube)

# Check that dimensions are still what we expect
print(stars::st_dimensions(data_cube))
```

#### Apply AOA mask to SDM

Species distribution models often produce suitability predictions across
the entire study area, including regions where extrapolation occurs
beyond the environmental conditions used for model calibration. AOA
identifies whether predictions fall within a known environmental space
(`AOA = 1`) or outside it (`AOA = 0`).

- **Align dimensions**. The taxonomic and temporal dimensions of the
  suitability cube (`suit_cube`) are aligned with those of the AOA cube
  (`AOA_cube`) using `st_set_dimensions`, ensuring element-wise
  correspondence between arrays.

- **Apply masking**. The suitability array is filtered using the AOA
  array: values outside the AOA (`AOA = 0` or missing) are replaced with
  `NA`.

- **Rebuild the masked cube**. A new `stars` object, `suit_cube_masked`,
  is generated from the masked array while preserving the same spatial,
  taxonomic, and temporal dimensions as the original suitability cube.

The resulting `suit_cube_masked` retains suitability values only where
the SDM operates within environmentally supported conditions. This step
connects model predictions (“what the model predicts”) with their
environmental validity (“where the model should be trusted”), providing
a spatially explicit assessment of model transferability and
reliability.

``` r
# 4.1 First, be sure suit_cube and AOA_cube share the same dimension labels
suit_cube <- stars::st_set_dimensions(
  suit_cube,
  "taxon",
  values = stars::st_dimensions(AOA_cube)$taxon$values
)

suit_cube <- stars::st_set_dimensions(
  suit_cube,
  "time",
  values = stars::st_dimensions(AOA_cube)$time$values
)


# 4.2 Extract raw arrays
suit_arr <- suit_cube$suitability   # numeric array [cell, taxon, time]
aoa_arr  <- AOA_cube$AOA            # 0/1 or TRUE/FALSE array [cell, taxon, time]

# 4.3 Mask: set suitability to NA wherever AoA == 0 (or AoA is NA)
suit_arr_masked <- suit_arr
suit_arr_masked[ aoa_arr == 0 | is.na(aoa_arr) ] <- NA

# 4.4 Rebuild a stars object with the masked suitability
suit_cube_masked <- stars::st_as_stars(
  list(suitability_masked = suit_arr_masked),
  dimensions = stars::st_dimensions(suit_cube)
)

# output
suit_cube_masked
